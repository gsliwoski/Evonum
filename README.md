# Evonum
Evolution simulator
GUI Branch includes tkinter-based simple GUI for plotting progress. Including the line "Plot" in testscript.txt loads the plotting GUI.

To run example:
python run_evonum.py testscript.txt

Example runs evolutionary algorithm based on predicting nth prime number given n for 1<=n<=1000

Current top 5 solver details are refreshed in daily_dump.txt

Other examples can be run by changing the forces in the testscript.txt

Force: 1, Simple, Equation, 5.3*pow(x,2)+log(x,e) - uncomment this line to add a force for predicting 5.3*pow(x,2)+log(x,e) for 1<=x<=1000

Force: 1, Dynamic, Equation, tan(x) - uncomment this line to add a force for predicting tan(x) for -pi/2<=x<=pi/2 using dynamic force that adjusts probability of x depending on solver performance.

Force: 1, Simple, Position, primes_1000.txt - this is the prime number force. 

Anything after '#' in script file is ignored.

Detailed explanations can be found in evonum_documentation.odt

test_*.py are unit tests meant to be run with pytest (http://pytest.org/latest/).
